# OpenAI Presence

A free Windows companion for sharing Codex activity on Discord, with locally detected model information, an elapsed timer and an animated galaxy.

**[Download for Windows](https://github.com/findastra/openai-discord-presence/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)**

## Start it

1. Install [Node.js 24 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download) if needed. No npm install is required.
2. Extract the download and double-click **Start OpenAI Presence.cmd**.
3. Keep Discord desktop open with activity sharing enabled, then click **Automatic**.
4. Optional: turn on **Run on Windows startup**, or double-click **Enable Automatic Startup.cmd**. Keep the extracted folder in place.

The Discord application ID and hosted image are included. No API key, bot token, account connection or art upload is needed. Settings and custom applications are optional.

## What Discord shows

The profile card contains the detected model and effort when available, an optional project name, and a session timer. Discord can use the registered application name in other surfaces, such as voice-channel activity labels.

Both companions can run together, but Discord may display only one activity at a time. A successful local RPC acknowledgement means Discord accepted the update; it does not prove every card is visible. Check the full profile and Discord’s activity privacy settings.

Automatic reads recent primary Codex task metadata, excluding archived tasks and subagents. It hides after five minutes without a recent update. Background metadata updates can extend that window; long silent reasoning can exceed it. It does not track window focus. Unavailable or stale model metadata is labeled **Using OpenAI**, rather than guessed.

**Start session** stays active until **Stop sharing** or **Quit app**. The timer measures this companion’s continuous active session, not model computation time. Closing the browser tab leaves the companion running.

## Project sharing

Project sharing is off by default. Turn on **Show my project on Discord** to publish a folder name, or enter a fixed project label. Full paths and chat titles are never published. When several recent sessions rotate, each project keeps its own model and effort. With a fixed label or sharing disabled, the newest session supplies the model and effort. Sessions without a usable project show **Exploring ideas**.

## Updating and startup

Before starting an updated or relocated copy, choose **Quit app** in the old control panel. The launcher checks the running installation and source build; it reports a conflict instead of silently opening an older copy. If the folder moved, enable startup from the new copy again.

To disable startup, clear **Run on Windows startup** or run `node scripts/startup.js --remove`. This also disables Automatic on the next launch. The startup installer creates default settings for a fresh download and validates configuration before replacing an existing launcher.

## Optional custom application

Create an application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), then replace the Application ID in Settings. The image field accepts an uploaded asset key or a public HTTPS image URL. Uploaded assets are static; external URLs support animated images. The default uses a hosted GIF.

## Privacy

The detector opens Codex’s local SQLite task database read-only and reads model, effort, update time and folder metadata. It never reads prompts, replies or chat titles. Saved project names may be used when a real folder is unavailable.

The control server binds only to `127.0.0.1`, checks Host and Origin for changes, and sends no telemetry. Discord receives activity text, a timestamp, an image URL and an optional project label. Settings remain in the Git-ignored `.local/config.json`. The local status endpoint includes installation/build identity so the launcher can detect old running copies; that identity is not sent to Discord.

## Development

```sh
node --test
node src/server.js
```

The controls use `http://127.0.0.1:38761/`. `OPENAI_PRESENCE_PORT` changes the port only when running the server directly. `node scripts/package.js` refreshes the hosted preview and Windows ZIP; the preview does not control Discord.

The galaxy artwork is original. This independent project is not affiliated with OpenAI or Discord. Product and model names identify the software being used.
